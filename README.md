# NEIGHBORHOOD SCANNER

Neighborhood scanner is a web tool which provides potential home owners with valuable information. Users can see different points of interest located around a real estate location: from supermarkets, hospitals, schools, gyms, health and fitness centers to restaurants, pet stores, etc. Users are also shown relevant updated real estate information from [Zillow](http://www.zillow.com), such as price, price-history, price-ranges,etc. Real estate information is fed from [Zillow](http://www.zillow.com), therefore it is crucial that the information of the real estate property be available at this site; this site will only work with properties listed in this website and nowhere else. 

This gist of the application is to provide the user with all the information he/she may need about a neighborhood before making a purchasing decision.
